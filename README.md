Explainable AI:  On the Reasoning of Symbolic and Connectionist Machine Learning Techniques

This repository contains all of the code that I wrote for my masterproject.
It includes all the files required for:

  1. The replication study of Bench-Capon (1993)
     (This includes code for the neural networks, the decision tree algorithm and the association rule classifier)
    
  2. The experiment concerning symmetrical Boolean function.
  
  3. The experiment concerning Dutch tort law.
